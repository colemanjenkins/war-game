# War Game Application

Build is hosted here: https://war-game-launch-challenge.netlify.app/

### IMPORTANT NOTES:
This was more of an excercise for in developing something quickly than a real project

Stopped working on it at the end of the day (5:30) 

### Functionality details:
The game works well until you have a tie. I was still working on that close to the end of the day. The game continues but for some reason adds extra cards sometimes to the winner of the extra cards drawn after the tie.

I'm also not sure what happens when the game is over (though it seems like it should work correctly). I wasn't able to test that because that takes literally forever. If I was to put more work into this, I would just simulate an ending and test the ending, as well as fix the tie situation
